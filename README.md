Computer Networks-Home Switch Automation using RAW Sockets

This project is a home automation switch built using raw sockets with a simple GUI for both server and client sides.It allows multiple clients to connect to a single server
and control household appliances. Any changes made by the client side are visible in the server side and vice versa.This ensures synchronized control and live updates across a 
system. The server runs a multi-threaded architecture system which allows multiple users to control appliances and the administrator can start or stop the server and manually control appliances from the server window itself.

This project also implements SSL(Secure Socket Layer) to ensure encrypted communication between the server and client. This adds a layer of security protecting all data transmitted over the network including appliance control commands and user login details. By using SSL, we ensure that the system is safer from potential network-based attacks or unauthorized access.
