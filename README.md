Computer Networks-Home Automation Switch using RAW Sockets

This project represents a home automation switch built using raw sockets with a graphical user interface(GUI) designed for both server and client sides. It allows multiple clients to connect to a single server and control various household appliances. Any changes made on the client side are instantly reflected on the server side, and vice versa, ensuring synchronized control and real-time updates across the system. The server follows a multi-threaded architecture system where each connected client is handled independently. This allows multiple users to control appliances, and the administrator can start or stop the server and manually control appliances from the server window.

Additionally SSL(Secure Socket Layer)is implemented to ensure encrypted communication between the server and client. This adds a layer of security, protecting all transmitted data, including appliance control commands and login credentials, making the system more secure against unauthorized access or network-based attacks.
